# Charity Application
Goal of the application is to create place where everyone can share unused items and donate them to charity organizations in need. Everyone has some things at home that are not used and would like to share them for charity, but there is no easy way to do it. This is where Charity Application comes in: it connects people who want to share with organizations in need.

- users can register and login,
- after login users have donate form available,
